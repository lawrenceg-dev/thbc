          <p class="p-text">Trades Hall Bowling Club was founded in Edwardian times. The club is named after the Trades Hall. The building was used by Trade Unions who 
            represented trades such the Bleachers and Dyers - who were connected to the Calico textile printing industry of New Mills - as a meeting place, office and social club. Trades Hall was on the site circa 2005.
